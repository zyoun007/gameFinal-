You peak through the window and see a dark interior (2) with a messy table, and two doorways that lead further to the back of the hut. 
One of the doors goes to the right, and the other goes to the left. 
There are no windows, and everything is shrouded in darkness. 

Below are your options: 

1) Open the left door 
2) Open the right door
3) Flea
4) Search the table
