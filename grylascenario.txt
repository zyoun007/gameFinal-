Grÿla haunts your nightmares and raises your deepest fears. 
She has stolen your peace and robbed you of sleep. 
She seems as if she knows your every thought. 
Standing at the edge of a dark forest, you peer into the trees and see Grÿla's hut. 
It seems there is no choice but to approach and face your greatest fears.
